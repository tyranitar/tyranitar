### 👋 Hello there, welcome to my GitHub page

My name is Tyron and I'm the creator of [Zetanote](https://zetanote.com). I enjoy the following activities:

- Training and deploying ML models in the cloud.
- Getting React to do exactly what I want.
- Wrangling Docker and Kubernetes.

About me:

- 🎓 University of Waterloo alum.
